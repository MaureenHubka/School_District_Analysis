# School_District_Analysis

# Background

After running analysis on the Py City School district, evidence of academic dishonesty was reported. Specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We have been asked to remove the ninth grade scores and rerun the 
analysis. To do this we replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. We then repeated the school district analysis. This is a report to show how these changes affected the overall analysis.
